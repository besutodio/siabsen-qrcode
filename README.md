# Si Absen - Attendance Website Application

Si Absen is a website-based application built to simplify the attendance process for students and teachers. By implementing QR Code based attendance. Students or teachers only need to scan their identity card which is equipped with a QR Code into the website application.

Created using :
- Django Web Framework
- Vue.js CDN
- [HTML5 QR Code](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode)

## Installation

Using the latest version of Django Web Framework.

```bash
django 5.0.2
```

Using the latest version of python

```bash
python 3.11.8
```

Create a [Virtual Environment](https://revou.co/panduan-teknis/python-virtual-environment) first so that dependency installation is separate from general Python dependencies. After activating the Virtual Environment, please install the required dependencies. Go to the project folder, until there is a `req.txt` file. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r req.txt
```

## Usage

Make sure it is still in the project folder, which contains the `manage.py` file. To access the website or activate the server as follows.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Server akan berjalan di `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
